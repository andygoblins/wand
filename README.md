Wand
====
A text editor for wizards.
>The wand chooses the wizard, Mr Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that you will do great things.

None of the other editors—ed, vi, sam, emacs, notepad++, sublime—have chosen me, not even Rob ~~Peverell's~~ Pike's  _Elder Wand_, acme. So I guess I'll have to build one myself.

Right now, there's not much to see here--just some editing interface experiments. Hopefully, someday these experiments will culminate with me Ctl-x-c'ing out of Emacs for the last time.
